# Step Project "Cards"

# Description
Step project after module Advanced JavaScript (Dan.it learning program) 

The task was to implement a web page where the person could create cards describing planned visits to doctors.
We had to apply ES6 classes, fetch and ES module structure.
Before logging in you have to register here https://ajax.test-danit.com/front-pages/cards-register.html
Or you can use these: 
*Log:* **test111@mail.com** 
*Pass:* **123**

After authorization, you should create some new visits to different doctors.
You can add new, edit or delete visits.
Try to filter visits like you want.
Visits are also draggable.
Editing the visit also changes its status from done to open.
